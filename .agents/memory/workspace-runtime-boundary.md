description: Runtime ownership rules for project previews versus Replit-managed artifact workflows.
---

The application runtime may supervise explicitly profiled processes owned by a user project, but it must not replace, duplicate, or claim control over Replit-managed artifact workflows.

**Why:** The API process cannot safely restart the process that owns it, and artifact workflows receive platform-managed routing and lifecycle configuration that an application-level replacement would not preserve.

**How to apply:** Keep project runtime controls server-owned and bounded; use a separate supervisor for durable multi-service ownership, while treating EngineeringOS artifact workflows as external platform-owned services.

Project runtime ownership is durable in PostgreSQL, not in the API heap: a worker holds a short lease and heartbeat, releases ownership without killing a detached preview during graceful replacement, and a later worker adopts only when the recorded PID and port are reachable.

**Why:** API workers are replaceable, while a project preview may legitimately outlive one worker; lease-qualified adoption prevents two workers from controlling the same process.

**How to apply:** Every runtime mutation must be conditional on the current worker lease, and recovery must mark unreachable rows failed rather than inventing a new process identity.
