description: Proposal lifecycle release follows attempt-scoped effect acceptance; crash recovery must remain fail-closed.
---

Keep a proposal's Git-committable lifecycle blocked until the same execution attempt has a durable acceptance bound to an `OBSERVED` effect bundle. A source change can be physically present and its proposal status can say `applied` while lifecycle remains blocked; neither is proof that acceptance succeeded.

**Why:** Filesystem promotion, the apply journal/proposal update, and acceptance finalization cannot share one atomic transaction. A crash can leave promoted bytes without accepted effect. Git commit eligibility uses proposal lifecycle, so releasing it early could permit a commit after missing or failed proof.

**How to apply:** Release lifecycle only after effect acceptance is durably accepted. If the route crashes or the lifecycle projection update fails, retain the blocked state and return or preserve a non-success result. Recovery must use attempt-bound acceptance plus fresh direct workspace observations; a journal, receipt, or proposal status alone is not evidence.
